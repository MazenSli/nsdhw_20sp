## Question 1

- [x] Reimplement `Line` class by using STL containers instead of raw pointers
- [x] Code needs to be built by executing `make`
- [x] When source file changes `make` needs to pick it up and rebuild
- [x] `make run` needs to produce the correct terminal output, without crashing
- [x] `make check` redirect the terminal output to a file `result.txt`
- [x] `make clean` needs to remove all the built and intermediate files
