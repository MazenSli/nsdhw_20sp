Motion Matching
=============================

In realtime animation field like Game, animation is often splited into several Animation States.
As animations and according states increases, it's nightmare for creators to process them maually.
Hence game companies such as Ubisoft keep introducing animation processing technique to improve that problem.
One of the latest and widely used techniques is **Motion Matching**.


Introduction
=================
.. The GitHub repository (URL) hosting your term project.
.. Here before everything, you may write a simple statement (preferably one
.. sentence) to introduce the project.




Problem to solve
================
.. Describe the problem you want to solve.  Include necessary background
.. information without making it a technical paper.

.. Some points may help you organize the problem description:

.. 1. The field or industry of the problem.
.. 2. The physics and/or the mathematics behind the problem.
.. 3. The algorithm or numerical method that should be applied for solving the
..    problem.



Perspective users
=================

.. Describe the users of your software and how they will use it.
.. This section may be combined with the previous one (`Problem to solve`_).  It
.. should use a subsection.

System architecture
===================

.. Analyze how your system takes input, produces results, and performs any other
.. operations.

.. Describe the system's work flow.  You may consider to use a flow chart but it
.. is not required.

.. Specify the constraints assume in your system.  Describe how it is modularized.

API description
===============

.. Show how a user programmatically uses your system.  You are supposed to
.. implement the system using both C++ and Python.  Describe how a user writes a
.. script in the system.  If you provide API in both C++ and Python, describe
.. both.

Engineering infrastructure
==========================

.. Describe how you plan to put together the build system, testing framework, and
.. documentation.  Show how you will do version control.

.. You may use continuous integration, but it is not required.  If you use it,
.. describe how it works in your code development.

Schedule
========

Itemize the work to do and list the work items in a timeline.  Estimate the
efforts of each item.

References
==========

List the external references for the information provided in the proposal.
